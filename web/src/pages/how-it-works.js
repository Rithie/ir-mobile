      <h3>How does a remote work anyway?</h3>
      <p>
        When you point a remote at an electronic device and press a button, a
        beam of invisible infrared light flashes very quickly in a pattern that
        the device recognizes as a control code. This "code" is nothing more
        than a number that's been encoded in the flashes of light.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you point your remote at a Lighthouse and press a button, the
        Lighthouse keeps track of those numbers and sends them back to your
        phone. Once your phone knows which numbers to flash, it can control all
        of your devices, as if you were pressing buttons on the remote.
