# ir-mobile

## React Native App + Arduino Uno + ESP8266 WiFi module. 

Replace every remote control in your house with a single app. ir-mobile will listen to the infrared codes your remote controls emit and map them to buttons in the app.

### Hardware
- Arduino Uno
- ESP8266 WiFi Module
- 3.3v USB to TTL adapter (for providing correct voltage to ESP8266 — I used [this one](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01HXT8DZ4/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1))
- 4 1kΩ resistors
- 2 2kΩ resistors
- IR Transmitter LED
- IR receiver component


### You will need to install
- [ESP8266 library](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino#installing-with-boards-manager)
- [Arduino IRemote library](https://github.com/z3t0/Arduino-IRremote#irremote-arduino-library)

### API

Where `ESP_IP_ADDRESS` is the ESP8266, for example `192.168.86.99/rec`

- GET `ESP_IP_ADDRESS/rec`: puts hardware in 'listening' mode for IR codes
- GET `ESP_IP_ADDRESS/stop`: stops record mode
- GET `ESP_IP_ADDRESS/check`: returns value of any IR codes heard
- GET `ESP_IP_ADDRESS/send?type=CODE_TYPE&value=CODE_VALUE&length=CODE_LENGTH`: transmit code via IR

### Wiring
I had to use two slightly different wiring configurations: one for uploading code and one for running my sketch. The 'upload' configuration _can_ run your code if you remove the Tx Rx connections to your USB to TTL adapter, but the ESP8266 won't reload your code after reboot, meaning you'll need to re-upload your sketch every time it boots. [Check the Boot Mode docs for wiring](https://arduino-esp8266.readthedocs.io/en/latest/boards.html#boot-messages-and-modes). Plug both the arduino and the USB to TTL adapter into my laptop via USB, and select the appropriate port in the Arduino IDE to upload.
